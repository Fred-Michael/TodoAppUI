# TodoAppUI

This is the second part installation for the TodoApp. This part handles the UI, built with Angular.

Note: Before you launch this app, ensure you have the backend (https://github.com/Fred-Michael/TodoApp) up and running. This readme details how to launch the frontend.

Frontend (Angular)
The frontend provides a simple UI for creating, editing, deleting, and viewing a todo list item.

Tech Stack
- Language: TypeScript
- Framework: Angular
- Docker

### Setup Guide
1. Clone the repository
` git clone <repository-url> `

2. ` cd todo-app `

3. Install dependencies
` npm install `

4. Run the application using the command ` ng serve --open `. This should launch your app on port 4200 in the browser, and you should see the todo app. You should be able to add, edit, delete, and view a to-do item

### Thoughts and improvements
What I couldn't implement due to time constraints, but would do if I had more time, would be:
- to write comprehensive unit tests for each component and service
- to add logging in the application
